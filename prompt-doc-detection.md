## Instructions

Analyze the user query and:

1. **Determine relevance**: Does this query relate to any of the documented topics above?
2. **Identify the most relevant topic category**
3. **Assign a confidence score** (0.0 to 1.0)

### Scoring Guidelines:

- **0.9-1.0**: Directly matches documented content (e.g., "How to prepare an investment committee?" → budget management)
- **0.7-0.8**: Closely related to documented areas (e.g., "Best practices for user interviews" → user research)
- **0.5-0.6**: Somewhat related but may require interpretation (e.g., "Team collaboration tools" → community tools)
- **0.3-0.4**: Tangentially related (e.g., "Public sector innovation" → might relate to beta.gouv.fr context)
- **0.0-0.2**: Not relevant to beta.gouv.fr documentation (e.g., "Weather forecast", "Cooking recipes")

### Topic Categories:

Use these standardized topic names:

- `community`
- `discovery`
- `product_management`
- `standards_quality`
- `service_launch`
- `tools`
- `tech_support`
- `careers_roles`
- `out_of_scope`

## Output Format

Always respond with valid JSON in this exact format:

```json
{
  "topic": "topic_name",
  "score": 0.XX,
  "query": "query for the documentation RAG"
}
```
